  <h1 class="project-about">About the project</h1>
  <p class ="about"> The team Diversity has created this website with a good students. We have used different types of languages, we learnt java-script, HTML, CSS and Python over the week. We also have looked at the web design.</p>
  <p class = "about">Then team is made up of three people these people are  Grace Scouler, Evangelos Liapis and Javier Corona. The three of us had to have good communtication and teamwork. We are on work expericence but we did come across a problem. One problem was that we found it hard to talk to each other as we didn't know each other very well in the beginning. By the end of the week it became eaiser to talk to each other as the week went on.</p>
  <p class =  "about">Evangelos had a problem with misplacing a file. Javier didn't have any problems making the website, as he asked questions to the supervisor. Grace was new to computer science, so found it harder than the other two, but by the end of the week they were all on the same page.</p>
